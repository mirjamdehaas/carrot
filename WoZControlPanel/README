This git contains the latest version of the Study Control-Panel. If you don't want to install Visual Studio you just can use the .exe in the WoZControl\bin\Release folder.

Important things:
    - If you want to move the ControlPanel you have to copy the .config file. This file is for storing the preferred language selection.
    - You will need an folder C:/l2tor/memories where the GUI is searching for stored memories.
      The interactionmanager will store them in that directory (first step too a centralized storage of files)
    - If you connect to the connectionmanager, you will get notifications about other running modules. This can take up to 5 seconds.
    - To start the interaction, when all necessary modules are loaded, you first have to load or create a memory for the new child (therefore the interactionmanager is required)
    - After loading/creating a memory you can use the "Start Lesson" button to start the interaction. Most of the other buttons are still out of function.

NEWS!!! Checkpoint system:
    - If you load a memory you will see the last status of the interaction in the down most info section. So IF a crash was there, it will show that the
      previous session has NOT be finished and if a checkpoint was found for that session the task id and subtask id will be shown from where the interaction will go on.
    - If a checkpoint was found the "Continue Lesson" button is activated and you can continue the lesson. But for the case you get stuck, because something with the checkpoint is wrong
      you can start the session from the beginning again by pressing "Start Lesson" as normal.
    - If NO checkpoint was found but the system crashed and the child is in the mid of the interaction --> An info will be shown that there is no checkpoint available to be loaded and
      the session will start from the beginning (the "Continue Lesson" button also will be disabled.
